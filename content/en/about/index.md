PMX-1 is [my](https://franks-reich.net) passion project born out of my love for
electronic music production and my career in software development. Starting out
with just software, in the box as the cool kids say, nothing can beat the
tactile feel of knobs and buttons. Trying out lots of hardware, with all kinds
of mixers, quickly lead me to the conclusion that there's something missing, a
mixer that truly unlocks the power of music production software and hardware.

This desire also lead me to discover other fellow musicians (well, to be
honest, it's a stretch to call myself musician), trying to fit something into
that gap; most notably the incredible [EZBOT](https://www.ezbot.live/) with his
Oktatrack based work, and the very insightful performance setup videos by the
live techno powerhouse [Surco](https://www.youtube.com/@SURCOlive).

Built with Love

To Make us Happy
{.h1 .text-center}

Because, be real, who of us didn't cuss out aggregated audio devices and
ASIO4ALL, while trying to keep track of the 50 something audio cables scattered
across the floor? Wouldn't USB plug and play be nice? How about automation in
the mixer? Remote control?

Yeah, I know, I'd love that too!
