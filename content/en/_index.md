Performance Mixer: PMX-1, or just PMX-1 for short, is a revolutionary
performance mixer, unleashing the power of [pipewire](http://pipewire.org/) and
[wireplumber](https://pipewire.pages.freedesktop.org/wireplumber/) for limitless
audio mixing. Thanks to linux and pipewires ability to make us of, and combine,
all kinds of audio interfaces, PMX-1 allows us to combine professional audio
interfaces, consumer grade audio interfaces, and music hardware with integrated
audio interfaces, for example the Roland TR-6S. And because it's running on your
computer, you could still use a DAW if you had too...
