## Layer Selector

The cross-fader on the CMD-1 functions as a layer selector. If it is on the
left half of the cross-fade range, every controller is controlling layer A,
otherwise they control layer B. The layer selector is also shown on the
[Open Stage Control GUI](/docs/open-stage-control-gui#layer-selector).
