PMX-1 currently supports two midi controllers, the Faderfox PC4, and the
Behringer CMD-1, as well as one USB HID device, that can also be used as audio
interface, the Native Instruments Traktor Z1.

The two midi controllers are usable with the default configuration, plug and
play, the following sections describe how to use them. The Native Instruments
controller needs some configuration before it can be used, the necessary steps
are described in the [Traktor Z1](/docs/control-surfaces/traktor-z1/) section.
