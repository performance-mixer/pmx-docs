PMX-1 is a performance mixer build on top of [pipewire](http://pipewire.org/)
and wireplumber. For an overview if what PMX-1 can do, see no further than the
[Overview](/docs/overview) section. If what you find there sounds interesting,
head to the [Getting Started](/docs/install) section to get PMX-1 up and
running.
